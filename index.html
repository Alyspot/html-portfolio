        <h2>Welcome to my corner of the internet!</h2>
        <p>If you've ever wondered what it's like to make a leap from the call center industry to become a full-stack
            developer, you're in the right place. I'm not your typical tech guru with a Computer Science degree or a
            fancy coding bootcamp certificate. Instead, I'm a self-taught programmer who, for over 8 years, honed my
            skills in the bustling world of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). But that wasn't where my heart truly
            belonged.</p>

        <p>Deep down, I've always been captivated by technology and the endless possibilities it offers. The BPO
            industry served its purpose, but it never quite fulfilled my passion for programming, problem-solving, and
            creating digital magic.</p>

        <p>So, with determination, a thirst for knowledge, and a love for all things tech, I decided to rewrite my
            career path. Join me on this journey as I navigate the exciting terrain of becoming a full-stack developer,
            despite the unconventional route I've taken. Together, we'll explore the trials, triumphs, and
            transformation that come with chasing one's dreams in the world of IT.</p>

        <p>If you're also considering a shift in your career, or if you simply share my passion for technology, you're
            in good company. Let's embark on this adventure together and inspire each other along the way. Welcome to my
            website â€“ where call center experience meets the captivating world of code!</p>

        <h2>My Experiences and Journey as a Call Center Agent</h2>

        <div class="row">


            <div class="column">
                <h3>Travel Agent</h3>
                <p>"In my previous role as a Travel Agent, I honed my customer service skills by assisting clients with
                    their
                    travel needs and ensuring their trips were seamless and stress-free. My ability to multitask and
                    prioritize allowed me to handle a high volume of calls and emails efficiently while maintaining a
                    friendly and professional demeanor."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="column">
                <h3>Service Desk Specialist</h3>
                <p>"As a Service Desk Specialist, I provided technical support to clients, troubleshooting software and
                    hardware issues, and providing timely solutions to resolve their concerns. My strong communication
                    skills and technical aptitude allowed me to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical
                    users effectively."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="column">
                <h3>Technical Support Specialist</h3>
                <p>"Finally, as a Technical Support Specialist, I demonstrated my ability to quickly resolve technical
                    issues
                    for clients by providing in-depth analysis, diagnosis, and resolution of technical problems. I also
                    collaborated with cross-functional teams to improve processes and procedures, resulting in a 50%
                    reduction in customer complaints."</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="excited">
            <p>
                I am excited to bring my diverse experiences in travel, service desk, and technical support. I am confident that my expertise, positive attitude, and passion for helping customers will be an asset to your team. I have embarked on a journey as a self-starter web developer, eager to apply my skills in creating innovative web solutions and contributing to your team's success.
